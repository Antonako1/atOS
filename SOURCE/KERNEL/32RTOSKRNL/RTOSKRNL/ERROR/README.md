# ERROR

Error handling mechanisms for the 32RTOS kernel.

Seldom used directly, as most kernel functions return error codes directly to the caller. Some functions may use this module for internal error handling and reporting but this is not common practice and usage is not documented at all.

This exists, but usage is discouraged.
